\begin{abstract}

Using the material covered in class, this project analyzes the control and
relative dynamics of two spacecraft in orbit around Earth by designing,
implementing, and testing several linear-quadratic-regulator (LQR) and model
predictive control (MPC) controllers. This is a subject of interest due to its
current usage in vehicle docking to space stations, as well as its future
applications to in-orbit debris collection, in-orbit assembly, and in-orbit
refueling.

We designed and implemented three infinite LQR feedback controllers: an
infinite LQR controller using the linearized system dynamics that stabilizes
the system at the origin; a trajectory tracking infinite LQR controller using
the linearized system's time invariant error dynamics; and a time varying
infinite LQR feedback controller that uses a nonlinear, but simplified, version
of the system's error dynamics. We also designed and implemented an MPC
controller using the time invariant linearized system dynamics, while
incorporating state and control constraints.

To test our controllers, we wrote a restricted two-body simulator to simulate
the dynamics of both the target and chaser vehicles. For simplicity, we modeled
the Earth as a perfect sphere and only considered the idealized dynamics due to
the gravitational interaction between the Earth and the satellites.

In order to further simplify the problem, several assumptions on the orbital
parameters of the two spacecrafts, the configuration of actuators, the ideal
behavior of the actuators, the control of the spacecraft attitude, and
knowledge of the spacecraft state are made.

\section{Introduction}

The rendezvous of two spacecraft, or more generally the relative positioning of
two spacecraft in orbit, is a complex problem due to the dynamics involved, and
has applications to a wide variety of missions and customers. At present, one
of the most important applications of this problem is in docking to space
stations, such as the ISS, by Dragon, Starliner, Cygnus, and other vehicles.
In addition, there are companies and organizations working on demonstrating the
ability to collect debris from orbit, how to extend vehicle lifetimes through
in orbit refueling, and how to assemble structures that are too large to be
launched in a single piece (such as space telescopes or space stations).

%==============================================================================

\subsection{Coordinate Systems}


In the rest of this document, we identify two spacecraft: the target and the
chaser (also referred to as the chief and deputy). The target is assumed to
have attitude control such that it maintains a consistent orientation with
respect to Earth's horizon but is otherwise inert. The chaser is the vehicle
that we focus on controlling the position of.

The first step in approaching the problem is to select a coordinate system in
which the relative dynamics will be studied. We identify two reference frames.
The Earth Centered Inertial (ECI) frame \cite{eci_frame} is used as our
reference inertial frame and is used for numerical propagation of the system
dynamics. As Earth orbits the sun, the ECI frame remains in the same
orientation relative to the stars. Similarly, as Earth rotates around its axis,
the ECI frame remains fixed relative to the stars. In the context of rendezvous
and proximity operations, it is convenient to also identify the
Radial-Transverse-Normal (RTN) coordinate frame centered with the origin at the
center of mass of the target vehicle, as shown in figure \ref{fig:rtn-frame}.
The three axes are aligned in the radial direction, along the vector from the
center of the Earth to the target; the transverse direction, parallel to the
target's velocity vector, and thus along the orbital path; and the normal
direction, parallel to the target's orbital angular momentum vector.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./figures/rtn-frame.jpg}}
    \caption{Radial-Transverse-Normal (RTN) Coordinate Frame}
    \label{fig:rtn-frame}
\end{figure}

Analyzing the chaser's dynamics and control in the RTN frame has the advantage
of much smaller oscillations in the position-velocity coordinates as
well as conveniently placing our target state at the origin.

Notice that as the target orbits the central body, the RTN frame rotates
relative to the inertial frame of the central body, so the relative position
and dynamics of the chaser is not just a translation from the inertial frame
(the actual dynamics are shown in the next section.).

We also define our position-velocity (PV) state vector within both the ECI
frame and the RTN frame as $[\vec{x}|\vec{v}]^T=[x,y,z,v_x,v_y,v_z]^T$ with
respect to each frame. Though not the state representation primarily used in
this project, several of the states from the classical orbital elements (COE)
are important. Note, however, that the COE states are only defined in the ECI
frame, not the RTN frame. The full COE state vector is

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:coes}
    \begin{split}
        e &= \text{Eccentricity} \\
        a &= \text{Semi-major axis (SMA)} \\
        i &= \text{Inclination} \\
        \omega &= \text{Argument of perigee} \\
        \Omega &= \text{Right ascension of the ascending node (RAAN)} \\
        f &= \text{True anomaly}
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

For this project, the three important orbital elements are: the eccentricity,
which is the eccentricity of our orbit's ellipse; SMA, which (for our purposes)
describes the orbital radius; and the true anomaly, which describes, unlike the
other states, where within the orbit we are, rather than the shape or
orientation of the orbit.

%==============================================================================

\subsection{Relative Dynamics}

Within the RTN coordinate frame the following relative dynamics can be derived
from the equations for motion around a central body \cite{sullivan_comprehensive_2017}:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:full-dynamics}
    \begin{split}
        \ddot{x} - 2\dot{f}_c\dot{y} - \ddot{f}_c y - \dot{f}_c^2 x & =
            \frac{-\mu(r_c + x)}{\left[ (r_c+x)^2 + y^2 + z^2\right]^{3/2}} +
            \frac{\mu}{r_c^2} + d_R \\
        \ddot{y} + 2\dot{f}_c\dot{x} + \ddot{f}_c x - \dot{f}_c^2 y & =
            \frac{-\mu y}{\left[ (r_c+x)^2 + y^2 + z^2\right]^{3/2}} + d_T \\
        \ddot{z} & = \frac{-\mu z}{\left[ (r_c+x)^2 + y^2 + z^2\right]^{3/2}} +
            d_N
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

Where $f_c$ is the target's true anomaly, $r_c$ is the target's radius, and
$\vec{d} = [d_R, d_T, d_N]^T$ represents the relative disturbing accelerations
between the target and the chaser in the target's RTN frame.

The first simplifying assumption we make is on the eccentricity of the target's
orbit. If the target's orbit is near circular (the eccentricity is near 0),
then $\dot{f}_c = \text{mean motion} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a^3}}$, where $\mu$ is
the Earth's gravitational parameter ($\approx 3.986\cdot10^{14} \text{
m}^2/\text{s}$), and $a$ is the orbit's semi-major axis (SMA). Thus,
$\dot{f}_c$ is constant and $\ddot{f}_c = 0$. In addition, the target's radius
is constant and $r_c = a_c$, where $a_c$ is the target's SMA. This leads to the
following simplified dynamics:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:circular-dynamics}
    \begin{split}
        \ddot{x} & =
            -\frac{\mu(r_c + x)}{\left[ (r_c+x)^2 + y^2 + z^2\right]^{3/2}} +
            \frac{\mu}{r_c^2} + 2n\dot{y} + n^2 x + d_R \\
        \ddot{y} & = -\frac{\mu y}{\left[ (r_c+x)^2 + y^2 + z^2\right]^{3/2}} +
            2n\dot{x} + n^2 y + d_T \\
        \ddot{z} & = -\frac{\mu z}{\left[ (r_c+x)^2 + y^2 + z^2\right]^{3/2}} +
            d_N
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

Linearizing this around the target's position, we arrive at the
following linear dynamics known as the Hill-Clohessy-Wiltshire equations \cite{cli_clohessy_nodate}:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:linear-dynamics}
    \begin{split}
        \ddot{x} & = 3n^2 x + 2n\dot{y}  + d_R \\
        \ddot{y} & = -2n\dot{x} + d_T \\
        \ddot{z} & = -n^2z + d_N
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

Which we can express in the standard state space form

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:linear-dynamics-state-space}
    \begin{split}
        \dot{x}_0 &= x_3 \\
        \dot{x}_1 &= x_4 \\
        \dot{x}_2 &= x_5 \\
        \dot{x}_3 &= 3n^2x_0 + 2n x_4 + d_R\\
        \dot{x}_4 &= -2nx_3 + d_T \\
        \dot{x}_5 &= -n^2x_2 + d_N \\
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

%==============================================================================

\subsection{Other Assumptions}

The reality of controlling a spacecraft involves complex actuators, possibly
including electric propulsion, mono-propellant attitude control systems,
reaction wheels, control moment gyros, magnetic torquers, and others, each with
their own dynamics and constraints (such as burn times, thrust profiles,
discrete or continuous thrust levels, etc) that need to be accounted for in
practice. For this project, only the dynamics due to gravity and accelerations
in the RTN frame are considered to simplify the analysis. Therefore, we are
neglecting the attitude control of the chaser and the arrangement (and
therefore selection) of thrusters such that we have have an idealized force in
the RTN frame as our only control input. However, in reality there may be
significant efficiency gains that can be realized by considering the
arrangement of thrusters when planning maneuvers.

In addition to assumptions on the actuators, we also assume that we have
perfect knowledge of both the target's and chaser's state vectors. However,
state estimation for spacecraft is a significant challenge and, depending on
the location (e.g. close enough for relative positioning systems), the
uncertainty in our knowledge can be quite significant.

%==============================================================================
%==============================================================================
%==============================================================================

\section{Simulation}

In order to test the controllers implemented, we created a simulation
environment and several test scenarios to evaluate their performance
\cite{rpo_repo}. The source code is available at
\url{https://github.com/ianruh/Rendezvous-Proximity}.

We wrote a restricted two body simulator to propagate the states of the target
and chaser in the ECI frame around Earth, where only the gravitational
interaction between the Earth and the single satellite is considered. All
nonidealities of the orbits, including oblateness perturbations, solar
radiation pressure, lunar perturbations, etc., were neglected. Due to the
relatively small timescales, distances, and parameters of the scenarios, these
effects would be small, though should not be ignored in practice.

At every control time step, the chaser's state vector was converted into a PV
vector in the RTN coordinate frame relative to the target. The simulator
saturated the control at 0.01  or 0.1 $\frac{m}{s^2}$, depending on the
simulation, which is reasonable for the monoprop thrusters on a relatively
small satellite.

The trajectory tracking controllers were provided a target state at each
control time step, where the target state was generated analytically or read
(and interpolated) from a CSV file depending on the scenario.

%==============================================================================
%==============================================================================
%==============================================================================

\section{Controllers}

We implemented four controllers. An infinite LQR controller that is able to
stabilize the chaser within the vicinity of the target, two trajectory tracking
infinite LQR controllers, and an MPC controller.

To evaluate the performance of the trajectory tracking controllers, we
calculate the integral of absolute error (IAE) for the actual trajectory vs the
tracked trajectory:

\begin{equation}
    \text{IAE} = \int_0^{t_f} e(t) dt
\end{equation}

%==============================================================================

\subsection{Infinite LQR Linear Controller}

Using the Hill-Clohessy-Wiltshire (\ref{eq:linear-dynamics})
expressed as matrices in state space form, we
implemented an infinite LQR controller that solves the following optimal
control problem:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:linear-infinite-lqr}
    \begin{split}
        \min_{x, u} \ \ \  & \frac{1}{2} \int_{t_0}^{\inf} \left( x(t)^T {\bf Q}
            x(t) + u(t)^T {\bf R} u(t) \right)dt \\
        \text{s.t.   } & \dot{x} = {\bf{A}}x + {\bf B}u \\
                     & x(t_0) = x_0
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

Where ${\bf A}$ and ${\bf B}$ are defined as


\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:linearized-state-space}
    \begin{aligned}
        {\bf A} & = \mat{
            0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
            0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
            0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
            3n^2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 2n & 0 \\
            0 & 0 & 0 & -2n & 0 & 0 \\
            0 & 0 & -n^2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        } \\
        {\bf B} & = \mat{
            0 & 0 & 0 \\
            0 & 0 & 0 \\
            0 & 0 & 0 \\
            1 & 0 & 0 \\
            0 & 1 & 0 \\
            0 & 0 & 1 \\
        }
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

and the ${\bf Q}$ \& ${\bf R}$ weight matrices were selected by starting from
the heuristic weighting $\frac{1}{(\text{error bound})^2}$, then modified by
trial and error. Then we solve the Algebraic Ricatti Equation (ARE) to find the
static state feedback controller

\begin{equation}
    \vec{u}(t) = -R^{-1}B^T P \vec{x}
\end{equation}

This controller successfully stabilizes the chaser in the vicinity of the
target, though the size of the region of stability appears to significantly
depend on the weight matrices Q and R chosen. Two scenarios are shown in
figures \ref{fig:above20} and \ref{fig:leading2000}.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./figures/simulation_outputs/above20InfiniteLQR-trajStateControl.jpg}}
    \caption{Orbit stabilization starting from 20 meter larger radius.}
    \label{fig:above20}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./figures/simulation_outputs/leading2000InfiniteLQR-trajStateControl.jpg}}
    \caption{Orbit stabilization starting from 2000 meters ahead.}
    \label{fig:leading2000}
\end{figure}

Aside from showing that our dynamics and basic approach work, these controllers
would have little practical use for rendezvous and docking, where safety
constraints on the spacecraft state (both position and velocity) are very
important. Therefore, we also implemented and tested two trajectory tracking
controllers, as discussed in the next section.

%==============================================================================

\subsection{Infinite LQR Time Invariant Trajectory Tracking Controller}

We implemented an LQR trajectory tracking controller based on the error
dynamics of the linearized system in (\ref{eq:linear-dynamics}). 
We define the state error $e(t) = x(t) - x_d(t)$, where $x_d$ is our desired
trajectory, and the control error $v(t) = u(t) - u_d(t)$, where $u_d$ is our
desired control. Then the error dynamics are

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:linearize-error-dynamics}
    \begin{split}
        \dot{e} & = \dot{x} - \dot{x}_d \\
                & = f(x, u) - f(x_d, u_d) \\
                & = f(x_d + e, u_d + v) - f(x_d, u_d) \\
                & = ({\bf A}(x_d + e) + {\bf B}(u_d + v)) - ({\bf A}x_d +
                    {\bf B}u_d) \\
                & = {\bf A}e + {\bf B}v
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

Where ${\bf A}$ and ${\bf B}$ are the same as in
(\ref{eq:linearized-state-space}). Conveniently, the error dynamics of the
linearized system are identical to the dynamics of the linearized system.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:inv-linear-track-infinite-lqr}
    \begin{split}
        \min_{e, v} \ \ \  & \frac{1}{2} \int_{t_0}^{\inf} \left( e(t)^T {\bf Q}
            e(t) + v(t)^T {\bf R} v(t) \right)dt \\
        \text{s.t.   } & \dot{e} = {\bf{A}}e + {\bf B}v \\
                     & e(t_0) = e_0
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

Being provided a trajectory to track, one which can be guaranteed not to
violate any safety constraints, is a more realistic scenario than just an LQR
controller attempting to stabilize the system at the origin.

We tested the trajectory tracking controllers on several 'box' trajectories at
varying orbital radii from Geo Synchronous (~42,000 km) to LEO (~8,000 km).

As the orbit gets smaller, the disturbing acceleration required to cancel out
the dynamics of the system begins to saturate the inputs, causing a loss of
control. This behavior is expected, as the 'box' trajectories ignore the
natural dynamics of the system, which become more significant the smaller the
orbit gets, and therefore needing more control authority to track.

\begin{figure}[t]

    has an IAE of $7.83\cdot10^6$.}
    \label{fig:box2000}
\end{figure}

%==============================================================================

\subsection{Infinite LQR Time Varying Trajectory Tracking Controller}

We also implemented a time varying LQR trajectory tracking controller based off
of the nonlinear dynamics shown in eq. \ref{eq:circular-dynamics}.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:nonlinear-error-dynamics}
    \begin{split}
        \dot{e} & = \dot{x} - \dot{x}_d \\
                & = f(x, u) - f(x_d, u_d) \\
                & = f(x_d + e, u_d + v) - f(x_d, u_d) \\
                & = F(e, v, x_d(t), u_d(t))
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

The time varying linearized error dynamics are then given by

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:nonlinear-error-dynamics-lvi}
    \dot{e} = {\bf A}(t)e + {\bf B}(t)v
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:ltvA}
    \begin{aligned}
        {\bf A}(t) &= \frac{\partial F}{\partial e}|_{x_d(t),u_d(t)}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:ltvB}
    \begin{aligned}
        {\bf B}(t) &= \frac{\partial F}{\partial v}|_{x_d(t),u_d(t)}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Rather than performing the derivation by hand, we used the symbolic mathematics
library SymEngine \cite{symengine_repo} to derive the symbolic matrices for
${\bf A}(t)$ and ${\bf B}(t)$. From the symbolic matrices, we performed code
generation at runtime to create a function for each symbolic matrix that, given
a vector of the desired state and control, returned ${\bf A}$ and ${\bf B}$.
The generated code was compiled to a shared object and then loaded into memory
and the function pointers retrieved.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:var-linear-track-infinite-lqr}
    \begin{split}
        \min_{e, v} \ \ \  & \frac{1}{2} \int_{t_0}^{\inf} \left( e(t)^T {\bf Q}
            e(t) + v(t)^T {\bf R} v(t) \right)dt \\
        \text{s.t.   } & \dot{e} = {\bf{A}}(t)e + {\bf B}(t)v \\
                     & e(t_0) = e_0
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

Figure \ref{fig:boxGEOvarying} shows a simulation run using the time varying
trajectory tracking controller and the associated IAE. Notice that the IAE
improved marginally (0.02\%) from the time invariant controller. This indicates
that, at least in the near circular case at GEO, the nonlinear error dynamics
that the invariant controller neglects play a very small role. For practical
purposes, it may not be worth the  extra computational resources needed to use
the time varying controller.

        time varying trajectory tracking controller. This
    simulation has an IAE of 10263.3.}

\end{figure}

%==============================================================================

\subsection{MPC Controller}

We implemented a discrete time MPC controller based off of
Hill-Clohessy-Wiltshire equations (\ref{eq:linear-dynamics}), which constrained
the maximum control, velocity, and state. The MPC controller was implemented
using CPPMPC \cite{cppmpc_repo}, and formulated as:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:mpc}
    \begin{split}
        \min_{\vec{x}_n, \vec{u}_n, n=1,...,N} \ \ \  & L_f(\vec{x}_N) + \sum_{n=0}^{N} \left( \vec{x}_n^T {\bf Q}
            \vec{x}_n + \vec{u}_n^T {\bf R} \vec{u}_n \right)dt \\
            \text{s.t.   } & \vec{x}_{n+1} = {\bf A}_d\vec{x}_n + {\bf
            B}_d\vec{u}_n,\ \ n=1,...,N \\
                           & \vec{u}_n \leq \vec{u}_{max},\ \ n=1,...,N \\
                           & \vec{u}_n \geq \vec{u}_{min},\ \ n=1,...,N \\
                           & \vec{x}(3:)_n \leq \vec{v}_{max},\ \ n=1,...,N \\
                           & \vec{x}(3:)_n \geq \vec{v}_{min},\ \ n=1,...,N \\
                        & \vec{x}_0 = x_0
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

Where

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:ltv}
    \begin{aligned}
        {\bf A}_d &= I_{6\times6} + {\bf A}\Delta t \\
        {\bf B}_d &= {\bf B}\Delta t
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

As this was not formulated as a tracking controller (though it could be easily
adapted to one by parameterizing goal state in the objective for every
time step), we tested this controller on just bringing the chaser to the target
when started within the vicinity of the target.

The CPPMPC library solves it using an interior-point primal barrier method. It
is capable of solving it in real time, though this depends on the time horizon
selected. In the simulations run, it ran at $\approx30$Hz on average with a 20
step horizon (using fairly aggressive hyper-parameters and warm starting each
iteration).

\section{Extensions}

There are many extensions and variations on the system and the controllers that
could be explored. Of interest to myself is extending the LTV
controller to the noncircular case, where the first and second time derivatives
of the true anomaly come into the system. This would enable the controllers to
function in a larger vicinity of the target, as well in elliptical orbits.

Similarly, it would be interesting to extend the simulation and controllers to
the restricted three body problem involving the Earth, Moon, and spacecraft. Of
particular interest, would be rendezvous and proximity operations in Near
Rectilinear Halo Orbits about the Moon (these are extremely elliptical orbits
that blur the line between lunar orbits and L2 halo orbits) where
the planned NASA Gateway manned space station will be.

The assumptions made about the configuration and actuators could also be
removed, specifically the arrangement of thrusters and its impact on the
efficiency of maneuvers would be interesting.
